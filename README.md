# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. TRPC was removed as there aren't many dynamic data fetching needs in this project. For server side data fetching I use React Server Components.

## Technologies used
I have modified the original template to include the following technologies:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Using latest version - Next.js 15 RC including React 19 utilizing React compiler for best performance
- [supabase](https://supabase.io/) - Used as postgres database, authentication layer 
- [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Beautifully styled and highly customizable components
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling
- [next-safe-action](https://next-safe-action.dev/) - For safe data mutations
- [zod](https://zod.dev/) - For schema validation
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For form handling
- [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) - For internationalization
- [bun](https://bun.sh/) - For package management
- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) - For theme switching support
